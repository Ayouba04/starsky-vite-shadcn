For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

CRITICAL UI STABILITY RULES:
- Never add or reintroduce Vite starter demo CSS (e.g., body{display:flex;place-items:center}, global button styling, root background hacks). Those break real layouts.
- Do NOT modify global foundation files (Tailwind config, base CSS, shadcn utilities) unless I explicitly ask. Build UI by editing pages/components instead.
- Prefer shadcn/ui components and Tailwind utilities for layout.
- If something looks off, fix it by adjusting component layout, not by changing global CSS.
